# Data We Collect
We do not collect any personally identifiable information about our users like their system fingerprint, hardware information, or any other such information.

Please note that when you launch Equinox, it rings home to our servers to request the latest version of the Android Package ("APK") download URL. We do not use this to log any information, but your IP address may be inadvertently logged in our servers during this transaction.
